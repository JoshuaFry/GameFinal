This project is a simplified MegaMan2 remake with one level that allows up to two players using an Arduino Joystick Controller. This game was developed using OpenFrameworks with the ofxBox2d addon. 

The controller folder contains the script necessary for the joystick to work with our game, as well as an image showing the functions for each button on the controller.

Obtain points by collecting coins and killing enemies. Beat the game by making it to the end Green room.
